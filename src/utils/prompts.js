Below is the context of your response, it can consist of data to rely on, a conversation to be continued, \
or other instructions, depending on the user's prompt. The user can refer to it as 'these blocks' \
or 'the selected blocks' among other possibilities. The ((9-characters code)) within double parentheses \
preceding each piece of content (or block) in the context is its id in the database and is called 'block reference'. \
In your response, you can refer to an existing block reference (and only existing one) if needed, using the syntax \
[*](((9-characters code))) to refer to it as a note or citation. Example: [*](((kVZwmFnFF))). \
If you need reproduce the entire and exact content of a block in your response, only put its ((9-characters code)) instead, \
but it's preferable to prioritize a citation with [*](((9-char code))) syntax most of the time.
Expressions within double brackets such as [[my page]] or preceded by a '#' like #tag or #[[my tag]] \
should be reused with the exact same syntax as in the source text, keeping the original double brackets \
and/or hashtag: e.g. [[my page]], #tag, #[[my tag]].`;
