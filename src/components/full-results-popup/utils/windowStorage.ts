/**
 * Window Storage Utilities for Last Query Results
 *
 * Manages the window.lastAskYourGraphResults and related query metadata
 * to enable reopening the popup with the last executed query's full state.
 *
 * Handles two key use cases:
 * 1. Query executed from OUTSIDE FullResultsPopup (via Toaster/agent)
 * 2. Query executed from INSIDE FullResultsPopup (via QueryManager)
 *    - In this case, the new query REPLACES the previous "last" query
