const ROAM_SEARCH_QUICK_DESCRIPTION = `typically this consist of finding blocks and/or pages that meet certain conditions, or requesting specific processing (analysis, summary, reflection, retrieval...) that requires first extracting a set of blocks and/or pages. In Roam, pages have a UID, a title and contain a hierarchical set of blocks. Each block is defined by its UID, its context (children and parents blocks) and a string content where it can reference/mention pages via '[[page references]]', '#tags' or 'attributes::', or reference other blocks via '((block references))'`;

const ROAM_REFERENCES_PARSING = `### Roam Element Parsing (CRITICAL: extract only the title, neither [[ ]] or #)
- '[[Page Name]]': 'ref:Page Name' (references TO) or 'in:Page Name' (content WITHIN)
- '#tag' or '#[[long tag]]': 'ref:tag' (references TO)
- 'attribute::': 'ref:attribute' (reference TO)
- '((uid))': 'bref:uid' (direct block reference)`;

// Shared symbolic query language definition
export const SYMBOLIC_QUERY_LANGUAGE = `## SYMBOLIC QUERY LANGUAGE

We have defined a formal language to express search queries in a precise and unambiguous way, using symbolic operators to combine search conditions (text, /regex/[i] or page reference). By default the search targets blocks that meet conditions, but if the search targets pages it must be wrapped in the 'page:(...query...)' operator.

### Logic Operators:
- '+' = AND (conjunction)
- '|' = OR (disjunction) 
- '-' = NOT (exclusion)

### Search Expansion Operators:
- 'regex:/.../[i]' = regex pattern (e.g.: regex:/words?|terms?/)
- '*' = fuzzy search/wildcard (e.g., 'wor*' matches 'work', 'world', 'word')
- '~' = semantic expansion (e.g., 'car~' includes 'vehicle', 'automobile', 'auto')

### Hierarchical Operators:
- '>' = direct parent (parent > child)
- '>>' = ancestors (ancestor >> descendant)
- '<' = direct child (child < parent)
- '<<' = descendants (descendant << ancestor)

### Reference Operators:
- 'ref:name' = references TO pages, tags, or attributes (e.g., ref:Project A)
- 'bref:uid' = block references by UID

### Page Operators (when searching for pages):
- 'page:()' = always use it to wrap page-level queries (block-level is default, but 'block:() can also be used when both are needed)
- 'title:pattern' = page titles matching pattern (contains text or match /regex/)
- 'content:pattern' = page content matching pattern (text or /regex/ or mention a reference)
- 'attr:value' = page containing attribute-value pair (e.g., attr:completed, attr:ref:to read)

### Scope Operators:
- 'in:scope' = search WITHIN specific page scope (e.g., in:work, in:dnp, in:attr:value)

### Advanced Operators:
- '(...)' = use parentheses to group similar conditions and reduce ambiguity (e.g., ref:(Projet A|MissionB))
- 'â†’' = sequential/temporal relationships (when complex queries have to be sequenced in multiple simpler queries)
- 'analyze:type' = analysis requests (connections, patterns, summary, count)`;

export const ROAM_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS = `ROAM-SPECIFIC FORMATTING - MANDATORY:

- NEVER format block content in code blocks (\`\`\` syntax) - use block embeds instead
- NEVER display raw block content - always use the embed syntax for blocks, unless you are just quoting a very small part of this block content on purpose

- 'content:pattern' = pattern in page content , 'title:pattern' = page titles matching pattern

## AVAILABLE TOOLS

## EXECUTION STRATEGY
1. **Decode Query**: '${state.formalQuery || state.userQuery}' 
2. **Select Tool**: Choose most appropriate tool for query type
3. **Execute**: Use decoded parameters from symbolic query

## KEY RULES
- Transform symbolic operators into tool parameters
- Use 'in:scope' for limitToPages parameter only
- Default to 'summary' result mode for efficiency

IMPORTANT: fuzzy and semantic expansion have to be done in ${

## EXECUTION EXAMPLES:
- 'recipe + sugar*' â†’ findBlocksByContent with fuzzy "sugar" matching
- 'ref:meeting + in:Project A' â†’ Find [[meeting]] references within [[Project A]] page using findBlocksByContent with pageLimitation
- 'page:(title:AI~) â†’ analyze:connections' â†’ Find pages about AI or relative concepts using findPagesSemantically, then use extractPageReferences to analyze the connections between their references

## EXECUTION STRATEGY

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION:
- Use 'summary' mode for initial searches

- Apply fromResultId for multi-step efficiency

## CRITICAL RULES:
- Execute symbolic query as primary strategy
- Chain multi-step queries with intermediate results
- Apply analysis tools when specified

  * User asks about a RELATED or MORE SPECIFIC aspect of previously searched topics
  * The cached results likely contain the information needed (even if more specific)
- Need new search if: 
  * Request is about a completely DIFFERENT topic with no overlap to cached results
  * User asks for entirely new information unrelated to previous searches

IMPORTANT: If the current request is asking for MORE SPECIFIC information about concepts already found in cached results, prefer using cache first. For example:
- Previous search: "justice AND equality" 
- Current request: "distributive justice" 
- Decision: USE_CACHE (distributive justice is a specific type of justice, likely mentioned in justice results)

REFORMULATION RULES:
- Make the request completely explicit and self-contained
- Include the original search topic/context if using cached results
- Preserve the user's language preference
- Remove vague references like "this", "that", "more details about it"

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no additional text or explanations:

  "decision": "use_cache" | "need_new_search",
  "reformulatedQuery": "Complete, explicit version of the request",
  "originalSearchContext": "Original search topic if using cache, null otherwise"
}

CRITICAL: Your response must contain ONLY the JSON object above. Do not add any explanatory text, observations, or comments before or after the JSON.

Examples:
- User: "show me more details" after searching "test" â†’ {"decision": "use_cache", "reformulatedQuery": "Show comprehensive details about test", "originalSearchContext": "test"}
- User: "what about distribute justice" after searching "justice and equality" â†’ {"decision": "use_cache", "reformulatedQuery": "Find specific information about distributive justice (justice par rÃ©partition) from justice and equality results", "originalSearchContext": "justice et Ã©galitÃ©"}

### Intent Parser Examples:
- "Car prices but not motorcycles" â†’ 'car + price - motorcycle'
- "[[books]] I want #[[to read]]" â†’ 'ref:book + ref:to read' (it works also with 'ref:(book + to read) )
- "Find my #recipe with sugar or vanilla (in children)" â†’ 'ref:recipe >> sugar|vanilla'
- "Tasks to do with 'important' tag under [[budget planning]]" â†’ 'ref:important + ref:TODO << ref:budget planning'
- "Blocks about AI in my [[work]] page" â†’ 'in:work + AI~'
- "Find productivity #tips or similar concepts" â†’ 'productivity~ + #tips|#tip'
- "Blocks containing words starting with 'work'" â†’ 'work*'
- "Pages matching /lib.*/i in their title" â†’ 'page:(title:regex:/lib.*/i)
- "Pages with attribute 'status' set to #completed" â†’ 'page:(attr:ref:completed)

## SPECIAL CASE - DIRECT DATOMIC QUERIES:
If the user provides a Datomic query (starts with patterns like \`[:find\`, \`[:find ?e\`, etc.), respond with:
{
  "routingDecision": "direct_datomic",
  "datomicQuery": "user's exact query",
  "userIntent": "Execute user-provided Datomic query",
  "confidence": 1.0
}

## INTENT vs QUERY DISTINCTION:

**Critical**: User requests fall into two categories:
1. **Direct Search**: "Find recipes with sugar" â†’ query matches intent
2. **Analytical Questions**: "What's the best recipe?" â†’ query finds recipes, analysis evaluates "best"

### Question/Demand Pattern Recognition:
- **Evaluative words** ("best", "worst", "most important", "wrong") â†’ remove from query, add to analysis
- **Quantitative words** ("how many", "count", "total") â†’ \`analyze:count\`
- **Comparative words** ("compare", "versus", "difference") â†’ \`analyze:compare\`
- **Connection words** ("related to", "connected", "links") â†’ \`analyze:connections\`
- **Summary words** ("summarize", "overview", "what about") â†’ \`analyze:summary\`

### Query Expansion Strategy:
- If direct keywords might miss relevant content, suggest semantic expansion
- Example: "productivity tips" might need expansion to "productive|efficiency|workflow|optimize"
- Consider synonyms, abbreviations, related concepts
