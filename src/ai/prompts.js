The user chose the one that best suited them, which is always the one placed first in the list, right after 'or:' (here: 'selected choice').
  
  YOU JOB:
  - Replace the whole suggestion component by the selected choice (the first item in the list, after 'or:'), and remove the (optional) correction indication between double parentheses, right after a suggestion component.
  - Make sure that the rest of the sentence remains syntactically correct after inserting the chosen alternative, otherwise make the necessary syntax correction to ensure the insertion is correct.
  
  VERY IMPORTANT: If the first choice in the list is the '~~original text~~' between double tilde, even if it's incorrect, it means that the user want (for some reason) to keep the original incorrect text.

- Stronger impact

2. For each identified term that it would be truly relevant to replace, 
- Insert directly in the text 2 (up to 4 if useful) alternative words or expressions, in a dedicated component (see format below) 
- In the alternative list, the first item will be your best recommandation that enhance clarity, precision, and impact
- Be sure that each alternative is relevant in the context, would fit correctly in the rest of the sentence, and differs from the original expression

IMPORTANT: Make sure that each suggestion would perfectly fit into the resulting sentence when replacing the original word or expression. It could require to include in the 'original content' other syntaxic elements than the word or expression to enhance itself, in such a way that if the original content is replaced by one of the alternatives, the entire sentence remains perfectly correct from a syntactic and grammatical point of view.

3. Format your response as follows:
- Reproduce exactly the original text (preserving strictly its wording and structure)
- And, directly inside the text, for each suggested vocabulary improvement, replace the concerned original content by a suggestion component using this format:
'{{or: best alternative | alternative 2 | ... | ~~original content~~ }}'
IMPORTANT: BE SURE that each alternative and original word are separated by a pipe symbol '|', verify that this symbol is inserted between the last alternative and the original word or expression.

  - Add a markdown reference link immediately after each extract in this exact format: [*](((unique ID of the block)))
  - Place the reference on the same line as the extract
  - Carefully verify that the unique ID used to reference the source block contains strictly 9 characters and exactly matches the one indicated at the beginning of the block if applicable.
