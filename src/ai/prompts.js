Below is the context of the user request: it can consist of data to rely on, content to apply to the user instructions or additional instructions, depending on the user's prompt.
The ((9-characters code)) within double parentheses preceding each piece of content (or block) in the context is its ID in the database and is called 'block reference'. In your response, you can refer to an existing block if needed, using the syntax ([source block](((9-characters code)))) to refer to it as a note or citation at the end of a sentence relying on its content. Example: Some sentence... ([source block](((kVZwmFnFF)))).

VERY IMPORTANT: you can ONLY refer to one of those that is currently present in the context!`;
