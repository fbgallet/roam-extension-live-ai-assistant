# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

This Roam extension now supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) which allows connecting to external servers to access remote tools, resources, and prompts.

## ü§ñ Agentive MCP Usage (Recommended)

The extension provides an **enhanced agentive experience** that goes beyond Claude Desktop capabilities. Each connected MCP server appears as an intelligent agent with advanced planning and coordination capabilities:

### Key Intelligence Features

- **Hybrid Execution**: Pure ReAct for single servers (maximum speed), strategic planning for multi-server coordination
- **Multi-Server Coordination**: Can orchestrate tools across multiple MCP servers simultaneously with intelligent planning
- **Context Optimization**: Efficiently manages conversation history to minimize token usage
- **Retry Intelligence**: Learns from previous attempts to improve response quality
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized approach reduces overhead for single-server operations

### Execution Modes

**Pure ReAct Mode** (single server):
- Direct tool reasoning and execution
- Maximum speed and efficiency
- Natural ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) loop
- No planning overhead

**Strategic Planning Mode** (multi-server):
- Coordinated execution across multiple servers
- Strategic planning for cross-server workflows
- Tool orchestration and dependency management
- Optimized server utilization

## Configuration

### 1. Adding an MCP Server

**Method 1: Via Extension Settings**
1. Go to the extension settings (`Live AI Assistant`)
2. Find the `MCP Servers` section
3. Click `Add Server`

**Method 2: Via Context Menu**
1. Right-click + Meta/Cmd to open the Live AI context menu
2. Click the satellite icon (üõ∞Ô∏è) in the top toolbar
3. Click `Add Server` in the configuration dialog
4. Fill in the information:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for the server
   - **URL**: The MCP server URL (WebSocket or HTTP)
     - WebSocket: `ws://localhost:3000/mcp` or `wss://api.example.com/mcp`
     - HTTP: `https://api.example.com/mcp` or `http://localhost:8000` (for local bridge)
   - **API Key**: (Optional) Authentication key if required
   - **Description**: (Optional) Description of server capabilities
   - **Enable**: Check to enable automatic connection

### 2. Using stdio MCP Servers (via Bridge)

Many MCP servers use stdio (standard input/output) for communication, which browsers cannot access directly. For these servers, you'll need to use the **Roam MCP Bridge**.

**Bridge Setup:**
1. Visit the [Roam MCP Bridge repository](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-mcp-bridge/blob/main/README.md) for detailed setup instructions
2. The bridge converts stdio MCP servers to HTTP endpoints that your browser extension can use
3. Follow the README to install and run the bridge locally
4. Once running, add `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured port) as the MCP server URL in your extension

**Why a Bridge is Needed:**
- **stdio MCP servers** communicate via standard input/output (designed for desktop applications like Claude Desktop)
- **Browser security** prevents direct process spawning and stdio access
- **HTTP bridge** acts as a translator between browser HTTP requests and stdio MCP servers
- This enables access to the full ecosystem of stdio-based MCP servers from your browser extension

### 3. Testing Connection

- Use the test button (satellite icon) to verify connection
- Status is displayed with color coding:
  - Green: Successfully connected
  - Red: Connection error
  - Gray: Disabled

## Usage
