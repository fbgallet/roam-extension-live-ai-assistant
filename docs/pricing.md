NB: Prices may have changed (generally decreased) since the last update of this document. Additionally, the price of cached input tokens is not shown here and is not included in the calculations made in Live AI Assistant. However, using the same prompt repeatedly utilizes the cache, which significantly lowers the cost of requests (for example, with OpenAI, cached inputs are half the price).
