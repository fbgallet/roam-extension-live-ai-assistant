# Speech-to-Roam

**Voice transcription, translation (to english) or vocal prompting to a GPT model, using OpenAI Whisper API or Web Speech API.**

‚ö†Ô∏è this extension works currently on Windows and Chrome MacOS but not iOS nor Android. Use iOS "Speach to Roam" shortcut instead.

By default, the controls will be inserted in the left sidebar. It's possible to display them in the topbar (always visible).

**Keyboard hotkeys** (available when recording):

- Pause/Resume: `Spacebar`
- Stop and rewind: `Escape` or `Backspace`
- Transcribe: `T or Enter`
- Translate (in English): `E`
- Speak to ChatGPT: `C`

**Commands** (in command panel)

- Toggle on/off Icon (in the left sidebar or in the topbar, depending on your choice in the settings)
- Voice Transcription
- Translate to english
- Speak to GPT assistant

### Voice transcription

- the transcribed text will be inserted at the bottom of the current page or appended to the current focused block.
- if you have not entered any OpenAI API Key, or if you disable Whisper, the free Web Speech API will be used to transcribe audio (‚ö†Ô∏è not available in Electron Desktop app and Firefox browser)
- by default, the language should be automatically detected, but you can specify it for better results, using the [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

_‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI Whisper API is a paid but quite cheap service_

`$0.006/minute` (rounded to the nearest second)

To give you an idea, using Whisper for 10 minutes a day for a month equates to 1,8$

### Translation

A large number of [source languages are supported](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/supported-languages), but the target language is currently limited to English. This limitation can be easily overcome through post-processing using a GPT model, as it only requires asking it to translate into any language.

### Speak directly to a GPT model

- ask any question, rephrasing, completion, translation! Feel free to specify the expected format of the response (its length, style, etc.).
- model by default is currently `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`
- you can try other chat completion model, or your own fine-tuned models
- assistant response is inserted as last child of prompt block (current limitation: the answer is only one long block)
- additional context and other features to come, stay tuned ! üöÄ
