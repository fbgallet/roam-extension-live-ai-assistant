### Voice transcription
- the transcribed text will be inserted at the bottom of the current page or appended to the current focused block.
- if you have not entered any OpenAI API Key, or if you disable Whisper, the free Web Speech API will be used to transcribe audio.
- by default, the language will be automatically detected, but you can specify it for better results, using the [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

_‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI Whisper API is a paid but quite cheap service_

`$0.006/minute` (rounded to the nearest second)

To give you an idea, using Whisper for 10 minutes a day for a month equates to 1,8$


### Translation
A large number of [source languages are supported](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/supported-languages), but the target language is currently limited to English. This limitation can be easily overcome through post-processing using a GPT model, as it only requires asking it to translate into any language.


### Speak directly to a GPT model
- ask any question, rephrasing, completion, translation! Feel free to specify the expected format of the response (its length, style, etc.).
- model by default is currently gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
- you can try other chat completion model, or your own fine-tuned models
- assistant response is inserted as last child of prompt block (current limitation: the answer is only one long block)
- additional context and other features to come, stay tuned ! üöÄ
